It gets% these by taking a weighted sum of the monochromatic PSFs, where the weights are given by% the product of the passed LMS spectral sensitivities and the passed spectrum.  If SCE% is specified, the SCE at each wavelength is also incorporated when summing up the% monochromatic PSFs.%% The returned psfs are normalized so that they sum to unity.  If you want to figure% out the relative amount of light seen by each cone class, you need to take the% spectral sensitivities into account and also the SCE if you're using that.  The% routine does return the weighted average of the monochromatic sceFrac entries% for each cone type, to make this easier.%% Inputs - see comment in ComputePupilFunctionFromZernike for more details.%   wls -               Column vector of wavelengths over which to cone sensitivity and spectrum are specified.%   T_cones -           Cone spectral sensitivities in Psychtoolbox data format.%   weightingSpectrum - Weighting spectrum as a column vector.%   ... -               See ComputePSFFromZernike for description of remaining arguments.%% Outputs%   conepsf -           Calcuated psf for each cone in T_cones, third dimension indexes cone type.%   arcminperpix -      Arc minutes per pixel for returned psfs.%   coneSceFrac -       Vector with calculated SCE fraction for each cone type.%   psf -               Calcuated monochromatic psfs. Third dimension of returned matrix indexes wavelength.%   strehl -            Strehl ratio at each wavelength for monochromatic psfs.%   sceFrac -           Fraction of light actually absorbed at each wavelength when SCE is taken into account.%% The last three returned values are those returned by ComputePSFFromZernike.%% Note 1 on usage.  If you actually know the hyperspectral image input, you probably don't want to use this routine.% Rather, compute the monochromatic PSFs at each wavelength and do your optical blurring in the wavelength domain,% before computing cone absorbtions.  Doing so is a more accurate model of the physics.%% You would use this routine under two circumstances.  First, you might know that the image consists only of% intensity modulations of a single relative spectrum.  In this case, you could use that spectrum here and speed% things up, since you'd only have to convolve three times (one for each cone class rather than once for each% wavelength).  This strikes me (DHB) as a rather special case and not too likely to be of much practical use% because computers are so fast these days that worrying about the cost of the wavelength-by-wavelength computations% seems like it will often be more trouble than it is worth.%% Second, you might only know the unblurred LMS images and not have spectral data.  Then, this routine is useful for% providing an approximation to the blurring that will occur for each cone class.  For example, your data might% originate with a high-resolution RGB camera image, which was then used to estimate LMS values at each location.% Keep in mind that what you get in that case is only an approximation, since the actual blur depends on the% full spectral image.%% Note 2 on usage.  If you want to compute a strehl ratio quantity for the LMS psfs, the most straightforward% way is to call this routine a second time using a zcoeffs vector of all zeros.  This leads to computation% of diffraction limited monochromatic psfs that are then summed just like the specified ones.  Taking the ratios% of the peaks then gives you a fairly meaningful figure of merit.%% See ComputePSFFromZernike.%% 7/13/07   dhb    Made into a callable function, based on code provided by Heidi Hofer.%           dhb    Remove globals, fix case of fft, get rid of some vars we don't care about%           dhb    Don't write files here, optional plot supression.% 7/14/07   dhb    Change name a little.% 12/22/09  dhb    Return monochromatic PSFs as a cell array% 8/21/11   dhb    Update% Handle default argsif (nargin < 11 || isempty(sceParams))    sceParams = [];end% Force wavelengths to column vector formwls = MakeItWls(wls);nWls = length(wls);% Get weighted cone fundamentals, and% normalize each so it sums to one.nCones = size(T_cones,1);coneWeight = zeros(nCones,nWls);for j = 1:nCones    coneWeight(j,:) = T_cones(j,:).*weightingSpectrum';endfor j = 1:nCones    coneWeight(j,:) = coneWeight(j,:)./sum(coneWeight(j,:));end% Get psfs for each cone type[psf,arcminperpix,strehl,sceFrac] = ComputePSFFromZernike(zcoeffs,measpupilMM,calcpupilMM,wls,nominalFocusWl,defocusDiopters,sizeOfFieldPixels,sizeOfFieldMM,sceParams);[m,n] = size(psf(:,:,1));conepsf = zeros(m,n,nCones);for j = 1:nCones    for wl = 1:nWls        conepsf(:,:,j) = conepsf(:,:,j) + sceFrac(wl)*coneWeight(j,wl)*psf(:,:,wl);    endend% Normalize.
