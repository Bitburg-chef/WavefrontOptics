% v_wvfSVNVer121TestData
%
% Tests that we can reconstruct PSFs computed using version 121 of the
% toolbox (BrainardLab SVN server).  This was pretty early in the
% development, April 30, 2011, and prior to various major organizational
% changes.
%
% The version that generated the test data is saved as a branch on the
% BrainardLab SVN server, with the new test program that writes out the data. 
% If we need more test cases, can generate them there.
%
% This is not really an independent test of the underlying code, but does
% serve to verify that the basic computations still work as they did
% when we first got the code from Heidi Hofer.
%
% As of 7/4/12, it appears that there has been a switch in the spatial
% coordinate system of the PSFs. 
% I believe this happened because Heidi's code's x/y convention was mismatched
% to Matlab's row/col convention, and one of Brian's students switched this.  In
% addition, the y coordinate in Heidi's code ran in the opposite direction
% from the y coordinate in our code.  Again, we think current
% code matches the OSA conventions, based on a first principles reading of 
% the code as well as our current agreement with the PSF pictures in Autrussea
% et al.
%
% As of 7/29/12, it also appears that LCA was getting added in with the wrong
% sign in the ver 121 code. At least, it is getting added in with the opposite
% sign in that code.
%
% 7/4/12  dhb  Wrote first draft.
