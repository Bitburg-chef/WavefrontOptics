% Make plots of the wavefront aberrations we get for single Zernike coefficients.
% These ought to match up with standard pictures of the Zernike pyramid.
%
% The problem is that pictures easily availalbe on the web don't match up with
% each other.  Compare for example
%   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials (blue is postive)
%   http://www.telescope-optics.net/monochromatic_eye_aberrations.htm (red is positive)
%   http://www.traceytechnologies.com/resources_wf101.htm (green is positive)
%
% Even given the color reversals, the three sets don't agree.  There is some talk
% on the wikipedia page that their picture may be wrong for roughly half of the
% coefficients, and this view is consisten with our calculations.
%
% We match the picture at the telescope-optics page, except for defocus where
% we are negative in the center and postive at the edge, whereas they are positive in the center
% and negative at the edge.  (This picture is also off in terms of the piston, which should be
% red and not green.)
%
% We do match what is at http://www.traceytechnologies.com/resources_wf101.htm, once you
% flip the sign of the color coding in the pictures (and map their green to our blue).
%
% Our defocus picture does manifestly match the formula given in the OSA standard,
% where the radial dependency goes as (2*rho^2-1).  This is clearly negative for rho = 0, as
% we obtain.  Also, as I read the general formula for the Zernike's the OSA formula matches
% it for the defocus case (and presumably for others too, I didn't check.)
