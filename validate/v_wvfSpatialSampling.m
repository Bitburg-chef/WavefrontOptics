% v_wvfSpatialSampling
%
% Checks consistency of results for a diffraction limited calculation with
% different choices of spatial sampling parameters.
%
% There is an issue of normalization that we need to think about. Normalize
% psf's so that they integrate to 1 by simple summing, or take spatial
% sampling into account when normalizing?
